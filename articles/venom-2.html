					The New movie Venom 2: Let There Be Carnage is the exciting sequel to the popular first movie about a journalist, Eddie Brock, trying to take down the founder of the Life Foundation Carlton Drake. While investigating, Eddie merges with the alien Venom and receives superhuman strength and power. He must use this power to help other people and fight evil in the world.
					In an interview with Tom Hardy, the actor of Eddie Brock, describing his character, he said, “I think that he’s quite geeky and he’s quite a good guy, but still terrifying.” This is what captures the audience because his character can make people laugh but is also scary in a way for many people entertaining a variety of audiences.
					There are mixed reviews about the first Venom movie but most agree that it is entertaining and worth going to see. Screen Rant says, “Venom is certainly a flawed superhero movie, but Tom Hardy’s performances as Eddie Brock and Venom make for a fun and entertaining ride. Venom is undoubtedly good enough to be an entertaining time at the theater.”
