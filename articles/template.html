					Example:
					In Golden Gate Estates, a new park is getting good reviews with a variety of sports options for different ages. They offer an Aquatic Complex, Fitness Center, baseball, soccer, and football fields, as well as basketball courts all with lights. More interesting sports offered include 4 tennis and racquetball courts, shuffleboard, bocce courts, a paved fitness trail, picnics, restrooms, and even a boat ramp. The boat ramp is one of the best kept secrets at Golden Gate Estates with lots of room for parking and room to fish or just drive a boat around.
					The overall reviews are at 4.4 stars out of 5. Many people have left good reviews saying that there is a lot of space to walk and good views of wetlands and forests.

					Golden Gate Estates is a wonderful, luxury community with lots of privacy. A great place to retire surrounded by nature but still the most up to date place to live.
